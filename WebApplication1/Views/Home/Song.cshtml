        Nobody wants to wait for little miracles (Little miracles)<br>
        Nobody wants to say, &quot;I'm feeling secure&quot; (Feeling secure)<br>
        It's hard to be this big when I am feeling small (I am feeling small)<br>
        But I will keep on trying even when I fall<br>
        <br>
        So put one foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other<br>
        We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another<br>
        One foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other<br>
        We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        <br>
        Nobody wants to wait for little miracles (Little miracles)<br>
        Nobody wants to say, &quot;I'm feeling so unsure&quot; (Feeling so unsure)<br>
        It's hard to be this big when I'm feeling immature<br>
        But I'm gon' keep on trying even when I fall<br>
        <br>
        So put one foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other<br>
        We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another<br>
        One foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other<br>
        We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        <br>
        Oh, you may not see a particle but rainbows are disguised way out<br>
        Tellin' us we are enough<br>
        And if you wanna beat your chest 'cause you feel the emptiness<br>
        Go on and feel your loneliness<br>
        Go on and feel your loneliness<br>
        And call me 'cause we're both in this<br>
        <br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles<br>
        I don't wanna quit before the miracles (Before the miracles)
